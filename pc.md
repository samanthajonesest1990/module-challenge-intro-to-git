## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open source version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system that lets you keep track of your code and it's history, and Github is a hosting service that lets you manage your Git repositories. 
3. Why do we create a branch? git checkout -b (name of branch)
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? They let you compare changes to a push in a repository. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch is used to download commits, files, and reffs from remote repository to local. Git merge combines commits. Git pull fetches and downloads that code from remote repo and updates in local.
7. What is a merge conflict?  A merge conflict is a conflict that happens when competing changes are made.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You can resolve a merge conflict by opening it and making the neccessary changes and make a new commit.
